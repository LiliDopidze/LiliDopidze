## Hi there, 

I am a data Scientist with 4+ years of experience applying machine learning, NLP, and advanced statistical modeling to generate actionable insights. Trained as an economist, I bring expertise in causal inference, time series forecasting, and econometrics, alongside hands-on skills in clustering, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics. Proficient in Python and Stata with experience using libraries and frameworks such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and XGBoost. Skilled at building scalable analytical pipelines, translating complex data into clear recommendations, and bringing together technical teams with business stakeholders to deliver strategic solutions. 

## Skills
- Programming & ML: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Stata, PySpark
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI
- Advanced Analytics: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Time-Series (ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost), Neural Networks.
- NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, BERTopic, LDA, Falcon-7B
- Statistical Methods: A/B Testing, Hypothesis Testing, Econometrics, Impact Evaluation.
- Soft Skills: Design Thinking, Strong Communication, Stakeholder Management, Cross-functional Leadership, Critical Thinking, Problem-solving.
